    "You're back, my dear?"
    I hear the door opened, and there's only one dragon who has the key except myself.
    "Finally home... I missed you sooooo much my little white."
    He finds me in the kitchen, lies his head onto my shoulder. Warm heavy breaths keep brushing my cheek along with his sweaty smell. I almost forget how's that fluffy body feels like, but now I would keep it memorized.
    "I missed you too Alrt. But I think you better come off me now so I could continue preparing your dinner. And take a shower please. I love your smell but I know you are dusty all over."
    "Sure, but just a little longer..."
    "Fine..."
    He holds me tighter, sniffing, rubbing my belly and chest. I have to admit he kinda arouses me, though he couldn't tell since I'm wearing a chastity belt. He then sets me free cleaning himself. I have our meal prepared and serverd to the table right after he comes out of the shower with all his furs and feathers shining through the water drops. Yeah, that body of him. All covered under the sea-blue furs. Only the belly and wings snow-white. Of course and those crystalline spikes on his head and his back, as fascinating as emeralds. For weeks and months I've been dreaming of him, of his body...
    "...Fred, Fred!"
    "...Yes?"
    He snaps his fingers in front of my eyes, draging me back to reality.
    "What were you thinking?"
    "Nothing."
    I quickly pick up the chopsticks. My face would be red and hot like burning iron if there's no scales covering.
    "Really?"
    He looks into my eyes, saying in a quite playful tune.
    "Well, no. I was thinking about you actually."
    A smirk immediately shows on his face. Then he leans his body forward with a gentle kiss falls onto my nose.
    I have no idea how the meal was finished. My heart was pumping fiercely and my whole body was like burning in fire. Anyway, after helping me cleaning the dishes, he just lets himself fully realxed in our bed. Well, I know he's quite exhausted after a long journey, but I think he wouldn't refuse accepting some service of mine.
    "What are you doing down there?"
    That's what he says when I start rubbing one of his hind paw with my snout, while rubbing the other one with my forepaws. I can tell he's enjoying my accompany as his tail is slowly wagging and then gently grabs my neck. My tongue then is put to work. Since he has carefully cleaned himself, there's no much taste among those short soft furs beneath his paws. Still a little bit salty actually, guess he sweats a bit. For the other paw, I'm scratching the sole with the tips of my claws. Light giggles are coming out of his mouth, and his body's also quivering from my tickle.
    "Ha... Alright then. Now you have to finish what you just started."
    He grabs my neck up between the legs with his tail. That juicy pink meat of him is throbbing along with his pulse. Naturally, I hold it with my palm, massaging the tip with the help of his pre, leaning my cheek against the base. I'm obssesed with his scent and I can't help but moaning quitely. My own desire rises, desperately draging that metal belt locked on my crotch.
    Oh how I hate myself at the moment. I LOVE him, really love him, all of him. I love him when he focuses himself into his work. I love him when we hanging out together enjoy marvelous sceneries and delicious food. I love him when... When I could touch his flesh. It feels almost sinful the moment I realize that a part of my love toward him is based on the thirst of my instinct. It feels so wrong when I pent up merely from sniffing and touching him and it's our first meeting eachother after months of seperation. Should I be so shallow following my instinct? But... if even my body is craving for him without thinking, wouldn't that means that I'm destined to love him? It's not sinful or wrong. Instead, it's the proof of my love towrads him. But, but... that sounds like my lower body is contolling my upper part...
    "Fred!"
    "Yes?"
    His hindpaws steps on my back.
    "Daydreaming again, huh?"
    "Kind of..."
    I lie my head down. Massaging, staring.
    "Thinking of me?"
    "Yeah... I'm thinking... Would it be better to let you have a good rest first? You are indeed tired."
    He sits himself up a little. Fingers brush though my face.
    "So you aroused me and then decide to leave me like this?"
    "No, I just..."
    "Fred, I'm hungry for you as much as you do for me. Last time I got myself released was weeks ago, and it was nothing compare to your company. For you it's even way much longer. So why don't we just follow our hearts give ourselves a night?"
    I couldn't agree more.
