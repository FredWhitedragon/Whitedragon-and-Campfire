    "You're back, my dear?"
    I hear the door opened, and there's only one dragon who has the key except myself.
    "Finally home... I missed you sooooo much my little white."
    He finds me in the kitchen, lies his head onto my shoulder. Warm heavy breaths keep brushing my cheek along with his sweaty smell. I almost forget how's that fluffy body feels like, but now I would keep it memorized.
    "I missed you too Alrt. But I think you better come off me now so I could continue preparing your dinner. And take a shower please. I love your smell but I know you are dusty all over."
    "Sure, but just a little longer..."
    "Fine..."
    He holds me tighter, sniffing, rubbing my belly and chest. I have to admit he kinda arouses me, though he couldn't tell since I'm wearing a chastity belt. He then sets me free cleaning himself. I have our meal prepared and serverd to the table right after he comes out of the shower with all his furs and feathers shining through the water drops. Yeah, that body of him. All covered under the sea-blue furs. Only the belly and wings snow-white. Of course and those crystalline spikes on his head and his back, as fascinating as emeralds. For weeks and months I've been dreaming of him, of his body...
    "...Fred, Fred!"
    "...Yes?"
    He snaps his fingers in front of my eyes, draging me back to reality.
    "What were you thinking?"
    "Nothing."
    I quickly pick up the chopsticks. My face would be red and hot like burning iron if there's no scales covering.
    "Really?"
    He looks into my eyes, saying in a quite playful tune.
    "Well, no. I was thinking about you actually."
    A smirk immediately shows on his face. Then he leans his body forward with a gentle kiss falls onto my nose.
    I have no idea how the meal was finished. My heart was pumping fiercely and my whole body was like burning in fire.
