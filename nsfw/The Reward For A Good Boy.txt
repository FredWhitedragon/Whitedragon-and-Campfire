    Fred finally received a message from Arltoca by his phone instead of a letter.
    "All my works are done here. I'm heading back home right away and we are most likely meeting each other again tomorrow."
    He hardly slept that night, excitedly planning a warm welcoming for his most beloved dragon.
    Four months ago, Alrtoca left the city to assist some villages very far away. There was a kind of disease spreading uncontrollably. As one of the best doctors in town he voluntarily signed himself up going there to help. Since the infrastructures there is way below the average, he could only write letters to keep on touch with Fred. At first, it was estimated to be solve in a month or two. However the situation worsened faster than everyone's expect. Thus Alrtoca and other doctors could only stay there longer waiting for more assistance coming. By their great efforts and more and more support entered the region, now the situation is finally under control. For Alrtoca, it also means that he finally have the chance getting back his daily life with Fred.
    The new day is slowly coming as the sun lazily crawling above the horizon. Fred wakes up with his sleepy eyes. As fast as he can, he gets himself tidy and stormed out of the house straight to the market. In the plan he made last night while he was losing sleep, the first step of the welcoming is a luxury dinner.
    "Pork shoulder... streaky pork... beef flank... prawns... tomatoes... eggplants... peppers... chinese cabbage... a hell lot of spices... Did I really listed this many?"
    Fred wandering in the market, grabbing everthing he listed earlier. A lot dishes he would like to cook, it's a pitty there's only one meal with two dragons. Not much he could do or else it would just turn to waste.
    "Hello Fred, you are coming really early this morning."
    It's a colleague of him. A dragon with bule scales.
    "Alrtoca's coming back today. I want to make sure everything's prepared ASAP."
    "Oh, finally he could get some real rest. And I guess that belt is about to be taken off?"
    Fred looks down on his own crotch. A silver metal belt with a plate straps tightly around the base of his tail. It's a chastity belt. He promised Alrtoca that he would stay locked up until they meet again. Before this time they usually do this for a week or two. The longest time he stayed chasted was about a month. So at first he thought it would last at most one month longer. Now it is already four whole months since then.
    "Hopefully yes. But can you keep your voice down? It's in public!"
    "Why, there are only around a dozen of dragons here. Besides you've been wearing that thing and hanging around for months. Everyone has noticed it. In fact I would feel wierd if you take it off. At least for me it is already a part of you."
    Fred sighs lightly. Gently presses the belt and rubs a little.
    "I've already gotten used to it to be honest. Without your mentioning I wouldn't even notice it myself."
    "Humm, maybe you are actually enjoying being chasted?"
    "Shut up."
    The colleague giggles.
    "Alright, no more teasing. Treat your fluffy dragon well and I'll be seeing you on Monday."
    "'Course, see you then."
    The dishes aren't too diffcult to cook, yet too easy to prepare. Stir fries could wait, they are the best to be eaten right after cooking. Soap need more time to be ready. So beef and tomatoes are already in the pot boiling.
